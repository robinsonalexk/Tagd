This is a Proof Of Concept project for a forum esque site built in react and node.js with the database running via mongodb.

A partial self imposed challenge with this project was using minimal library support to avoid the usual javascript problem of package creep.
This project continues as a WIP but is currently in a semi functional state (i.e. minimal viable project but something "shippable")

# Current Todo
- Implementation of users
- Replies/Comment threats
- General beautification
